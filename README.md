REFLECTION

Unfortunately I'm right up against the deadline and I don't have time to write a project reflection here. A lot of the site still doesn't work and I didn't have time to do the stretch goals. It's mostly functional but very clunky. There are notes in the code. Full disclosure, I haven't had time to catch up with the CSS from Week 1 yet so I "borrowed" some of the styling from the animal slideshow example to get it working so that I could debug it.
