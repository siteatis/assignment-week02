     to landscape to get the "desktop experience" we should let them, then surely they
     will have at least 640px, but the larger thumbnails are also taller and in landscape
     they may not have enough pixels high for the thumbnails to be reasonably discreet
     behind the fullscreen image, so large display may still be inappropriate? Hopefully
     this addresses that? -->
